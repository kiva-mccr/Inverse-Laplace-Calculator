# Linear Circuits Calculator

This is a generalized purpose linear circuits (II) calculator currently supporting the below functionality:
- Inverse Laplace
- Two Port Parameter Conversion
- ~~System of Equations~~ **(In-Progress)**
- Filter Grapher 

To open the calculator navigate to the [jupyter file](/Linear-Circuits-2-Calculator.ipynb) within the repository and click the "Open in Collab" button to open an online enviroment.
