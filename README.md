# Linear Circuits Calculator

This is a generalized purpose linear circuits (II) calculator currently supporting the below functionality:
- Inverse Laplace
- Two Port Parameter Conversion
- ~~Two Port Circuit Calculator~~ **(In-Progress)**
- ~~System of Equations~~ **(In-Progress)**
- Filter Grapher

To open the calculator navigate to the [jupyter file](/Linear-Circuits-2-Calculator.ipynb) within the repository and click the "Open in Colab" button to open an online enviroment.

[Alternatively this is the link to the github hosted colab version directly.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kiva-mccr/Linear-Circuits-2-Calculator/blob/main/Linear-Circuits-2-Calculator.ipynb)
